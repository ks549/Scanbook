# SCAN BOOK 

This webpage helps to provide book details on giving the ISBN number. I used asp.net/C# and MySQL as database using visual studio 2013 community. On giving the ISBN number it will look for valid ISBN and fetch the book details from database. If the ISBN is not stored in database, it will look in google book API and fetch the book details from that. The user can give notes about the book and post it for future review.
